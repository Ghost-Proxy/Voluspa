onboard_message = """Welcome to Ghost Proxy! <:ghost_proxy_2:455130686290919427>

If you haven't yet, please read through our `#rules-conduct` and `#server-info` and then feel free to explore the server! A good place to start is `#voluspa`, our very own Warmind where you can set game roles, check who's online, and use a number of other helpful commands (type `$help`).

If you have any questions about anything, feel free to ask in general chat, use the `$feedback` Voluspa feature (here in a DM even), or use the `@ghost-proxy-vanguard` ping to ask for help from the Ghost Proxy admin team.

\\*\\*\\*

And finally, a couple of steps to do now that you are a member:

1. Head to the `#charlemagne` channel and type `!register` -- you will receive a DM from Char, please follow the instructions :+1:

2. Join our Steam Group <https://steamcommunity.com/groups/ghostproxy>

3. Head to the `#voluspa` channel and type `$game-roles` and then add your Game Mode roles
  (Type `$help game-roles` for more info, and also check out `$other-games` also)

4. Join our Social Tower voice channel and start forming fireteams and have fun!

Thanks and eyes up, Guardian! <:cayde_thumbs_up:451649810894946314>

However, if you do get back into the game please let us know. More than happy to invite you back! :smiley: 

Also, you are totally welcome to stay in the GP Discord and chat/group for games! Plus, you have been granted the `ghost-proxy-legacy` role as tribute. <:ghost_proxy_2:455130686290919427>
